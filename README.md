#### Compiling - Part 1: Matrix Multiplication
To create and compile this project, I used IntelliJ IDEA, so all that I really did was configure the project with the basic Java libraries, and the JUnit libraries, and then use the command to run the MatrixText class, with the IDE recognizing it as a JUnit class and running the tests after compiling both MatrixTest and Matrix.

#### Compiling - Part 2: Quicksort
Nothing really different was done for the compiling in part 2 of the project. Still using IntelliJ IDEA with regular Java libraries and JUnit.
